# VaspDefAnalysis

**VaspDefAnalysis** is a Python toolkit designed to streamline the **post-processing and analysis of point defects** in materials using the **Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)**. It provides tools to interpret Kohn-Sham orbitals, extract key quantities, and visualize defect characteristics â€” making it easier to explore the electronic structure of defects in semiconductors and other materials.

## Features

- **Simple point defect creation using ASE:**
  - Easily set up defect supercells using the [ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/)
  - Extract and interpret eigenvalues from VASP output

- **Visualization Tools:**
  - Plot eigenvalues and localization factors
  - Generate customizable, publication-ready graphs

## Applications

- **Materials Science Research:**
  - Analyze and characterize point defects in semiconductors
  - Advance development of:
    - Electronic and optoelectronic devices
    - Single-photon emitters
    - Spin centers for quantum technologies

- **Academic Use:**
  - Support for education and research in solid-state physics and materials science
