# VaspDefAnalysis

VaspDefAnalysis is a specialized toolkit designed to facilitate the analysis of defects in materials using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). This package aims to streamline the processing and visualization of complex data sets generated by VASP calculations, specifically targeting defect-related studies in crystalline materials.

## Features
- **Eigenvalue analysis:**
  - Extract and interpret eigenvalues

- **Localization factor calculation:**
  - Evaluate electron localization around defects for insights into conductivity and optical properties

- **Visualization Tools:**
  - Plot eigenvalues and localization factor, customize graphs for publication-ready presentations

## Applications

- **Material Science Research:**
  - Analyze defects in semiconductors
  - Enhance the development of electronic, optoelectronic, and energy materials

- **Academic Use:**
  - Support research and education in solid-state physics and materials science
